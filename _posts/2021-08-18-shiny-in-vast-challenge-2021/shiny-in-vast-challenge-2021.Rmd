```

We built an Shiny application to display an interactive visualization dashboard. This is a group project based on our individual assignments of VAST Challenges 2021. The designs of all graphs were from our assignments.

The shiny apps were deployed on shinyapps.io, [click to view](https://ygliu.shinyapps.io/vast2021/). It might take a few minutes to load.

This is our project poster.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/poster.jpg")
```
