This is a group project based on our individual assignments of VAST Challenges 2021. We built an Shiny web application to display an interactive visualization dashboard. The designs of all graphs were based on our assignments and aim to help readers fix questions in VAST Challenges 2021 MC2.

The shiny apps were deployed on shinyapps.io, [click to view](https://ygliu.shinyapps.io/vast2021/). It might take a few minutes to load.

This is a project poster.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
