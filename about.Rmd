This personal blog is updated with my coursework in Singapore Management University. Initially, it was built to upload my assignments at the Visual Analytics and Applications course, taught by Professor [Kam Tin Seong](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/kam-tin-seong-486). After this course, I decided to keep updating posts about my other coursework and projects. Writing these public posts allows & drives me to revise and think deeper after the coursework submission.

The blog was built using [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), hosted on [netify](https://www.netlify.com/). A handy guide for creating such a blog can be found [here](https://lisalendway.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-09-buildingdistill/e).

The blog design was created with following graphics and CSS:

* [CSS Templates](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html#example-themes)
* [Illustration by Freepik Storyset](https://slidesgo.com/theme/economics-thesis#search-economics&position-0&results-4)
