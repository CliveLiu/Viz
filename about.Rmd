This personal blog is updated with the coursework of Visual Analytics and Applications, taught by Professor [Kam Tin Seong](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/kam-tin-seong-486) at Singapore Management University. And in the future, it might also be updated with my other coursework and projects.

The blog was built using [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), hosted on [netify](https://www.netlify.com/). A handy guide for creating a website can be found [here](https://lisalendway.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-09-buildingdistill/#customize-the-home-page).

The design of the blog was created with some graphics and CSS:

* [Illustration by Freepik Storyset](https://slidesgo.com/theme/economics-thesis#search-economics&position-0&results-4)
